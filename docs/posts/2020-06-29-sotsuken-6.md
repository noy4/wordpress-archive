# 卒業研究#6 〜Hello, world! My creation has started〜

（定例ゼミに英語の先生が2人集まるのでこれは英語練習のいいチャンスなのでは？と思い英語で報告にトライ）

I was supposed to read papers which the paper I read last week cited which is cited from the paper I read last week, but I didn't do that.

This A guy I met at "芸工就活何でも相談会！ -エンジニア編-" and I asked to let me experience his work gave me an assignment. That was to make an app using "Typescript" and "React"(programming technique).

I was going to make a survey-bingo-app with those techniques anyway, so I decided to do it this week.
